# iptables-geoport-directives

Simple shell script for GNU/Linux, built on iptables, which is able to filter 
incoming packets based on accepted port numbers and countries. It is aimed to 
SOHO users.

**Warning: THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED. HAVE A LOOK AT https://frnmst.github.io/automated-tasks/scripts.html#iptables-geoport-py
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT.**

### WHAT IS

This is a bash script suitable for GNU/Linux systems (but it might work on 
other *nix-like systems too) that is able to filter incoming packets from LAN 
and WAN based on standard port numbers and countries' IP addresses. It uses a 
simple stateful firewall structure. The user selects the "accepted countries" 
(using the ISO notation) and the "accepted ports" (which are automatically 
toggled to be TCP or UDP, depending on standard port numbers). It is also 
possible to decide the policy of filtered packets (polite or rude policy, 
depending respectively if you want that the sender knows that his packets have 
been rejected or not) and to set logging of filtered packets.

### Packet dependencies

- bash
- iptables active and running

### Howto

Download: `$ git clone https://github.com/frnmst/iptables-geoport-directives`.

Before uing this script you must have iptables active and running.
If you have systemd as init system: `sudo systemctl enable iptables && sudo systemctl start iptables`.

Change preferences in `iptables_directives.config` or create a new one.

You also must be root to run this script: `sudo ./iptables_direcives.sh -c iptables_directives.config`.

### Developement status

Achieved good points. The script works, but not sure about the logging part. 
Important features are missing, as explaned next.

### TODO

In order of importance:

1. ~~EXPORT VARIABLES IN EMPTY FILE TO BE PARSED BY THIS PROGRAM. FILE MUST BE 
   NAMED $0.config~~ **DONE**

2. Get current LAN ips automatically.

3. DO MORE COMPACT/EFFICIENT CODE WITH LESS VARIABLES AND unsetting UNUSED ONES.

4. Do better output (i.e. write [DONE] or [FAILED] at the edge right of the 
   shell using something like ncurses.

5. Make this portable, also for other shells & systems.

6. Check if iptables is running.

7. Not sure if logging works after iptables-save (i.e. when the rules 
   are applied after reboot).

8. Clean the code.

### Help

```
./iptables_directives.sh help
./iptables_directives.sh [-h | -r | -v] -c <file-name>
Options
	-c --config		configuration file
	-h --help		show this help
	-r --reset		reset iptables to default values
	-v --verbose		verbose at debug level
Exit codes
	0			OK
	1			Invalid option or too much parameters
	2			User launching program is not root
	3			iptables not running TO BE IMPLEMENTED
	4			Invalid Port
	5			No valid ip WAN list found
